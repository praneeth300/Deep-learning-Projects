### Image classification using CIFAR-10 and create simple gui using tkinter

__About CIFAR-10 Dataset__
* CIFAR-10 is a very popular computer vision dataset. This dataset is well studied in many types of deep learning research for object recognition.

* This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32/32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithm

Below the simple gui<br>
